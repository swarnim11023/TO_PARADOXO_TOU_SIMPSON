# SIMPSON'S PARADOX : THE MIRAGE OF DATA SCIENCE










## The Great War of Mathematics  

Letâ€™s journey back in time to the year **1711**.  

You find yourself in the midst of **The Great War of Mathematics**, a fierce intellectual battle fought between two legendary nemeses: **Isaac Newton** and **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**. Donâ€™t worryâ€”youâ€™re perfectly safe here (no arrows of logic or razor-sharp deductions will harm you).  

Both titans wield armies of unimaginable power, consisting of **axioms** and **theorems**, ready to clash for mathematical supremacy. Have you ever wondered what a true battlefield of mathematics might look like? If not, letâ€™s imagine it today!  

Since childhood, Iâ€™ve dreamed of having a hypothesis named after me. Guess what? Iâ€™ve concocted this completely nonsensical one  here ðŸ˜….  

<!-- From this point on, your journey into my hypothetical world begins...   -->

With that, I invite you to embark on a journey through my hypothetical world, **where math is not just theoryâ€”itâ€™s warfare**.

## The Setup  

- **Axioms** are like fearless infantry, forming the foundation of the army.  
- **Theorems** are the cavalry, swift and powerful, riding in to secure victory.  

Newtonâ€™s army boasts a formidable force of infantry  N<sub>i</sub> and cavalry  N<sub>c</sub>. Meanwhile, Leibnizâ€™s troops are equally valiant, with infantry  L<sub>i</sub> and cavalry  L<sub>c</sub>.  

<!--The battlefield is set. The war rages on for **five long years**, filled with intellectual maneuvers, strategic deductions, and battles of wits.

The battlefield is set. The war rages on for five long years, filled with intellectual maneuvers, strategic deductions, and relentless battles of wits. But in **1716**, just as **Leibnizâ€™s** forces seem poised for victory, disaster strikes. The great **Leibniz**â€”*not by logic or a rival theorem, but by a cruel irony*â€”*misplaces his spectacles* and vanishes from the battlefield, leaving his ideas to falter.

Both armies suffer tremendous losses over the course of this great war of ideas. As a mathematician in this hypothetical world, I now turn to the statistics that reveal the true scale of these intellectual casualties. Letâ€™s examine the graph below, where we begin to unravel the mystery behind the staggering losses on both sides.

<!-- 
_**The front that suffered fewer casualties was victorious.**_

**Which side do you think suffered greater casualties ?**

Most of you would have guessed Newton suffered more casualties just because both infantry and cavalry had higher casualty percentage.


**But Newton did not lose!!!!**


I myself was shaken by this truth but had to believe it when I saw the  overall data.Those still skeptical of my words, glance through the following graph.

<!-- Here's a revised and dramatic continuation of your article: -->

##  **The front that suffered fewer casualties was victorious.**

**Which side do you think suffered greater casualties?**

Many of you might assume that Newton's side took the brunt of the losses, especially since both his infantry and cavalry suffered a higher percentage of casualties. The evidence seems clearâ€”Newtonâ€™s forces appeared to be in far worse shape.

**But Newton did not lose!!!!**

This revelation struck me like a thunderclap. I, too, was shaken by the truth of it. Yet, the data does not lie. When I examined the overall statistics, the outcome was irrefutable. Those still skeptical of my words, I invite you to glance through the following graph.

 be less than that of Leibniz if at least one of the Newton's regiment's casualty rate had been less than that of Leibniz . There was no way that the weighted average of casualty rates could show such contrary results."_

<!-- - Common Sense** -->




<!-- 
I would like you  to give yourself a minute to think where the anomaly lies in our common senses.


Meanwhile Let us explore the demographics of both the armies. -->


Now, I ask you to take a moment and reflect on where the anomaly might lie. Why does our common sense seem to betray us? How could Newtonâ€™s side, despite higher casualties in both infantry and cavalry, emerge victorious?

The timing is perfect for a revelation!

Brace yourselfâ€”hereâ€™s the formal definition of Simpson's Paradox:
<br>
### **Simpson's paradox is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.**

While you ponder this, let us dive deeper into the demographics of both armies. Understanding the makeup of _Newton_ and _Leibnizâ€™s_ forces may provide the key to unraveling this perplexing paradox.

Notice the stark difference between the two armies. After examining these pie charts, the entire paradox unraveled before my eyes, reducing itself to nothing more than a simple oversightâ€”confounding variables. Do you see it? Let me explain.

<!-- What are confounding variables? -->

>**Confounding variables** are factors that influence other variables in such a way that they create misleading or distorted associations between them.

Earlier, we failed to account for a crucial variable: the composition of the army. Once we incorporate the effect of this, the mystery dissolves, and we arrive at a remarkably intuitive explanation for the Simpsonâ€™s Paradox we encountered earlier.

## WAS IT REALLY A PARADOX ?




Although Newton's infantry suffered a higher casualty rate than Leibniz's, it made up only 20% of Newton's army. In other words, while nearly all soldiers in Newton's infantry regiment perished, the regiment itself was relatively small. 

In contrast, Leibniz's army had a much larger proportion of infantry, with a significant casualty rate of around 50%. This combination of a larger infantry proportion and a higher casualty rate contributed to the overall casualty rate of Leibniz's army surpassing that of Newton's.

Lets put the Mathematics going behind in front of you.


From the graphs, the following observations are very straightforward:

+ casualty rate of _Newton's_ Infantry :<br> **C.R.<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub> = _80%_**
+ casualty rate of _Newton's_ Cavalry :<br> **C.R.<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_25%_**<br>

<br>


+ Percentage of infantry in _Newton's_  Army: <br>**P<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>=_20%_**
+ Percentage of cavalry in _Newton's_ Army :<br> **P<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_80%_**

<br>


#### **Overall casualty rate of Newton's Army = (C.R.<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>x P<sub>N<sub>i </sub> </sub>) + ( C.R.<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>x P<sub>N<sub>c </sub> </sub>) = _(80% x 20%) +(25% x 80%) = 36%_**

<br>

+ casualty rate of _Leibniz's_ Infantry :<br> **C.R.<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub> = _50%_**
+ casualty rate of _Leibniz's_ Cavalry :<br> **C.R.<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_20%_**

<br>

+ Percentage of infantry in _Leibniz's_  Army:<br> **P<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>=_80%_**
+ Percentage of cavalry in _Leibniz's_ Army :<br> **P<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>=_20%_**

<br>




#### **Overall casualty rate of Leibniz's Army = (C.R.<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub> x  P<sub>L<sub>i </sub> </sub>) + ( C.R.<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub> x P<sub>L<sub>c </sub> </sub>) = _(50% x 80%) +(20% x 20% )= 44%_**

<!-- 

(casualty rate of infantry ) \* (Percentage of infantry in Army)+(casualty rate of cavalry)\*(Percentage of cavalry in Army)=** -->
<br>

And you see, the mathematical results are consistent with the [figure 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5e9980b-b348-4fae-985c-fd65bae891a2) .




 >_**If data can be partitioned in such a way that a single Simpson's reversal emerges, then, logically, it seems inevitable that this reversal will continue as the data is divided even further.**_

This very phenomenon is vividly illustrated in Figure 3, where the casualty rates of four distinct military units are laid bare: Infantry I (the swordsmen of the first battalion), Infantry II (the archers of the second battalion), Cavalry I (the nimble, lightly armored cavalry), and Cavalry II (the mighty, heavily armored cavalry). With this partitioning, the data splits into four subsets, each telling its own tale. In every single one, Leibniz's battalion suffers greater casualties than Newton'sâ€”at least, that's what the numbers suggest.

<br>
<br>
Yet, as we zoom out and aggregate the data to the level of regiments, the tides begin to shift, and we encounter Figure 1. Here, a stunning reversal occursâ€”Leibniz's army now appears to have outperformed Newton's! But the twists do not end there. As we continue to aggregate the data, adding more layers, the final conclusion arrives, and once again, itâ€™s Newtonâ€™s army that emerges victorious considering the  overall casualty rate.


>**_Simpsonâ€™s paradox_ says
 however that this can occur; it is possible for any relation between two variables to be reversed
 in every component subpopulation**
<!-- Time is perfect to give you the formal definition for simpson's paradox. -->



This chain of reversals begs the ultimate question: **Which army truly proved superior?**

<!-- I provide you with even detailed demographics of both the armies and leave it up to you to verify the trend reversal we just saw. -->
I now present you with even more detailed demographics of both armies and leave it to you to verify the trend reversal weâ€™ve just witnessed.

Do you want to hear one more truth?

**Newton** and **Leibniz** never participated in any actual wars :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: . While their intellectual battle over the discovery of calculus is legendary, they never fought on a physical battlefield. This fact serves as a powerful reminder to snap us out of the hypothetical world we've been exploring.

**Now, we must return to reality**. Itâ€™s time to set aside our imaginative scenarios and consider the true implications of Simpsonâ€™s Paradox. You might be wondering:
 **How does Simpsonâ€™s Paradox manifest itself in the real world?**
 
 <br>

 It turns out, this paradox isnâ€™t just a theoretical quirkâ€”it appears in practical situations more often than you might think. Even during the **COVID-19 pandemic,** Simpsonâ€™s Paradox emerged: when comparing Case Fatality Rates (CFR) between China and Italy, Italy initially seemed to have a higher survival rate, but when the data was split by age group, the conclusion flipped.

For now, letâ€™s focus on one of the most well-known examplesâ€”a study comparing two approaches for treating kidney stones.

<br>
Picture yourself in a doctorâ€™s office, faced with a tough decision. Two treatments for kidney stones are on the table. One is cutting-edge, promising to be minimally invasiveâ€”like something from a sci-fi novel. The other? A tried-and-true method thatâ€™s been around for years.

The doctor presents the data: a detailed breakdown of success rates for both treatments, sorted neatly by the size of the kidney stones. Itâ€™s straightforward enough. At first glance, the numbers seem to point to a clear winner.

But do they really? Could there be more to the story?

## Unraveling the Mystery: The Simpson's Paradox at Work

Letâ€™s break this down step by step. At first glance, the data seems pretty straightforward. When you look at the treatments for small and large stones separately, the outcome is clearâ€”**treatment A** consistently outperforms treatment B for both small and large stones. So far, so good, right? Treatment A is the obvious winner in each case.

But hereâ€™s where things take an unexpected turn: when you combine the data for both small and large stones together, suddenly **treatment B** looks like the better treatment overall. 

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc3b8e6c-9fc3-452f-8c36-0a02b2d60f47" alt="Simpson-1">
</div>

**This seeming contradiction is rooted in the distribution of the data.**  

Here's what happened:

More patients with **small stones**, (which are generally easier to treat) were assigned treatment B. At the same time, a larger proportion of patients with **large stones**, (which are much harder to treat successfully) were assigned treatment A. **The size of the kidney stone, it turns out, has a much greater impact on treatment success than the choice of treatment itself.** Smaller stones have a much higher chance of success, regardless of which treatment is used. 

When we combine the groups, it creates an illusion that treatment B is more effective because more patients with small stones received it, and those patients had higher success rates. **But if the distribution of patients between the two treatments had been more balanced, this paradox would not have appeared.**

This is exactly why you canâ€™t always trust the overall numbers without considering how the data is divided. **Without factoring in the size of the kidney stone, you might draw the wrong conclusions.**

---

### Why This Changed Everything

Before this study, the size of the kidney stone wasnâ€™t considered a major factor in treatment successâ€”it was just another detail. But the studyâ€™s findings forced researchers to rethink this assumption. It became clear that **stone size was a key determinant of treatment success, a factor no one had properly accounted for.**

This lesson extends beyond kidney stone treatmentsâ€”itâ€™s a reminder that data can be misleading if not carefully interpreted. The numbers may seem clear at first, but they can hide deeper truths. Simpsonâ€™s Paradox teaches us to question assumptions and dig deeper before drawing conclusions.

****

**Do  still you believe the statistical phenomenon described above should be considered a paradox?**

>Mathematician **Jordan Ellenberg** argues that Simpson's paradox is misnamed as **"there's no contradiction involved, just two different ways to think about the same data"** and suggests that its lesson **"isn't really to tell us which viewpoint to take but to insist that we keep both the parts and the whole in mind at once."**

Although criticized, Simpson's paradox remains a fascinating and frequently explored topic in statistics and data analysis. Its ongoing study across diverse disciplines highlights the importance of nuanced statistical methods and the dangers of oversimplifying data interpretations.
